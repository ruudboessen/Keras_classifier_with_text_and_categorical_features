# keras_classifier_with_text_and_categorical_features
Keras classifier with text and categorical features.

The Jupyter Notebook presented here includes a demo of a single neural network to predict a dichotomous target (i.e. positive / negative sentiment) based on both text (i.e. twitter messages) and categorical data. The model was defined using [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [TensorFlow](https://keras.io/) as its backend in Python.  

The data came from: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment. It is also included in a ready-to-use comma separated text file.
